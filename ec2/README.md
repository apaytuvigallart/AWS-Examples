# Instance Types
Amazon EC2 provides a variety of instance types so we can choose the type that best meets your requirements. Instance types are named based on their instance family and instance size. 
- The first position of the instance family indicates the series, for example `c`. 
- The second position indicates the generation, for example `7`. 
- The third position indicates the options, for example `gn`. After the period (`.`) is the instance size, such as `small` or `4xlarge`, or `metal` for bare metal instances.
